TODO

features:
add a better placeholder image
add local keybinds (hotkey.js?)
add hotkey changer menu
view back button is a 100% height div that takes up the left side
add keybind to immediately focus the window
add more valid extractors (soundcloud, bandcamp, etc)
mass get song metadata (getJson > track, artist etc)
confirmation menu and dialog box
add multiple song selection to song page
action history with undo option
add an options page
add feedback notifications (e.g. a toast when you add a new song)
add wait for next frame to all draw pages?
display song being downloaded, and use the seeker bar as a loading bar to show progress.
peer-to-peer listen along
    maybe use browser protocols to share links
    see P2P technologies

play a playlist without skipping the current song
add button to queue to remove a song from the upcoming queue
    remember to clear the source buffer
make search only apply after finish typing for large playlists due to lag
rewrite the routing model? do i need to reinit pages every time??
get lyrics of song (muzicbrainz / genius maybe?)
add a cursor to visible search bars
add sound effects to buttons (e.g. mechanical click for the slider checkboxes)
song source should always be file and not stream
    not really feasible since they take time to download
show currently fetching song while it's being fetched
allow spam skipping
queue editing
store more efficiently
    currently songs appear multiple times for each playlist
    so instead each playlist should just reference a UUID

DONE (sort of):
scan clipboard for youtube links and prompt for adding song
manually add songs to a temporary playlist?
contextmenus for playlists and such
add styling to :active pseudo-selector to improve responsiveness
a playlist view
a song view


bugs:
fix flicker when adding/removing songs to playlist page
when playing a new song automatically, and it ends up with no source, a duplicate of the current song will be added to history.
context menu items still active even when right click, indicating that something will happen when in reality nothing happens
high gpu usage even when alt-tabbed?
playing songs sometimes stutter? may be to do with the visualiser, or smth else entirely
sometimes already played songs dont seem to have a file cache
    maybe fixed?
when song ends current time stops increasing but playback jumps to a random spot earlier
    maybe check if current time = duration to make sure song ends properly
    also just fade volume based on where current time is for song fading
